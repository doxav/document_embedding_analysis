abstract="The rapid development of digital technologies has made it possible to enhance teaching and learning spaces even in a complex discipline such as music composition, where however the right attention is still lacking regarding the learning style of students. Existing software, in most cases, propose methods for harmonizing a melody, but they rarely deal with the problems of the harmonization of music bassline. This article presents an intelligent adaptive algorithm to support the learning process of (dyslexic and non-dyslexic) students in the context of the harmonization of music basslines. The algorithm allows students to harmonize a music bassline, giving them advices (Virtual Tutor) in case of mistakes in the concatenation of the chords. Experiments have shown that this form of adaptive learning of the algorithm can improve students' ability to find solutions for the harmonization of music bassline. Future improvements of the method are discussed briefly at the end of the paper.",
