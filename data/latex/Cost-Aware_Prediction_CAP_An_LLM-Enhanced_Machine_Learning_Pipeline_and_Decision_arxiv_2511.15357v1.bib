We first collect eleven existing datasets covering diverse clinical language generation, understanding, and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we construct six novel datasets and clinical tasks that are complex but common in real-world practice, e.g., open-ended decision-making, long document processing, and emerging drug analysis.

It is essential to strike a balance between embracing the benefits of artificial intelligence-driven solutions and preserving the human touch that is vital for providing compassionate care. The exponential growth of medical data has paved the way for the integration of LLMs into healthcare, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance clinical decision-making and alleviate physicians' workloads. Recently, LLMs have exhibited remarkable potential across various clinical scenarios, including streamlining diagnostic processes, optimizing radiology reports, and providing personalized treatment recommendations. However, the implementation of LLMs in healthcare is not without its challenges. Issues such as the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, privacy concerns, and the risk of generating misleading or overconfident information are significant hurdles that must be addressed. Moreover, while LLMs can replace certain basic tasks traditionally performed by humans, it is crucial to recognize that senior clinicians play an irreplaceable role in complex decision-making and providing emotional support to patients. By harnessing the power of LLMs to augment human capabilities while maintaining essential human elements within healthcare, we might shape a future where artificial intelligence and human intelligence coexist harmoniously. Prioritizing ethical development and deployment for artificial intelligence, empowering healthcare professionals, and safeguarding patient privacy will be key to realizing the full potential of LLMs in revolutionizing healthcare delivery. Through ongoing research, collaboration, and adaptation, responsible integration of LLMs holds promise for elevating both quality and accessibility globally, ultimately creating a more efficient, personalized, and patient-centric healthcare system.}

However, current strategies for predicting risk are only modestly successful, likely because they are derived from statistical analysis methods that fail to capture prognostic information in large data sets containing multi-dimensional interactions. .....................................................................................................................................................................
Methods We used a machine learning algorithm to capture correlations between patient characteristics and mortality. A model and results was built by training a boosted decision tree algorithm to relate a subset of the patient data with a very high or very low mortality risk in a cohort of 5822 hospitalized and ambulatory patients with HF. From this model we derived a risk score that accurately discriminated between low and high-risk of death by identifying eight variables (diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, haemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, albumin, and red blood cell distribution width). This risk score had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and was predictive across the full spectrum of risk. External validation in two separate HF populations gave AUCs of 0.84 and 0.81, which were superior to those obtained with two available risk scores in these same populations. .....................................................................................................................................................................

	abstract = {Background: Heart failure ({HF}) is a global problem, affecting more than 26 million people worldwide. This study evaluated the performance of 10 machine learning ({ML}) algorithms and chose the best algorithm to predict mortality and readmission of {HF} patients by using The Fasa Registry on Systolic {HF} ({FaRSH}) database. Hypothesis: {ML} algorithms may better identify patients at increased risk of {HF} readmission or death with demographic and clinical data.
Methods: Through comprehensive evaluation, the best‐performing model was used for prediction. Finally, all the trained models were applied to the test data, which included 20\% of the total data. For the final evaluation and comparison of the models, five metrics were used: accuracy, F1‐score, sensitivity, specificity and Area Under Curve ({AUC}).
Results: Ten {ML} algorithms were evaluated. The {CatBoost} ({CAT}) algorithm uses a series of decision tree models to create a nonlinear model, and this {CAT} algorithm performed the best of the 10 models studied. According to the three final outcomes from this study, which involved 2488 participants, 366 (14.7\%) of the patients were readmitted to the hospital, 97 (3.9\%) of the patients died within 1 month of the follow‐up, and 342 (13.7\%) of the patients died within 1 year of the follow‐up. The most significant variables to predict the events were length of stay in the hospital, hemoglobin level, and family history of {MI}.
Conclusions: The {ML}‐based risk stratification tool was able to assess the risk of 5‐year all‐cause mortality and readmission in patients with {HF}. {ML} could provide an explicit explanation of individualized risk prediction and give physicians an intuitive understanding of the influence of critical features in the model.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study sought to develop models for predicting mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization for outpatients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial.
BACKGROUND Although risk assessment models are available for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, few have assessed the risks of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF.
METHODS The following 5 methods: logistic regression with a forward selection of variables; logistic regression with a lasso regularization for variable selection; random forest (RF); gradient descent boosting; and support vector machine, were used to train models for assessing risks of mortality and HF hospitalization through 3 years of follow-up and were validated using 5-fold cross-validation. Model discrimination and calibration were estimated using receiver-operating characteristic curves and Brier scores, respectively. The top prediction variables were assessed by using the best performing models, using the incremental improvement of each variable in 5-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS The RF was the best performing model with a mean C-statistic of 0.72 (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.75) for predicting mortality (Brier score: 0.17), and 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.71 to 0.81) for HF hospitalization (Brier score: 0.19). Blood urea nitrogen levels, body mass index, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) subscale scores were strongly associated with mortality, whereas hemoglobin level, blood urea nitrogen, time since previous HF hospitalization, and KCCQ scores were the most signiﬁcant predictors of HF hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS These models predict the risks of mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with HFpEF and emphasize the importance of health status data in determining prognosis.

Methods: eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) was used to construct a new prediction model (XGBoost model) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database (MIMIC-IV) (training set). The eICU Collaborative Research Database dataset (eICU-CRD) was used for the external validation (test set). The XGBoost model performance was compared with a logistic regression model and an existing model (Get with the guideline-Heart Failure model) for mortality in the test set. Area under the receiver operating characteristic cure and Brier score were employed to evaluate the discrimination and the calibration of the three models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value was applied to explain XGBoost model and calculate the importance of its features.
Results: The total of 11,156 and 9,837 patients with congestive HF from the training set and test set, respectively, were included in the study. In-hospital allcause mortality occurred in 13.3\% (1,484/11,156) and 13.4\% (1,319/9,837) of patients, respectively. In the training set, of 17 features with the highest predictive value were selected into the models with LASSO regression. Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were strongest predictors in SHAP. In the external validation, the XGBoost model performance was superior to that of conventional risk predictive methods, with an area under the curve of 0.771 (95\% conﬁdence interval, 0.757–0.784) and a Brier score of 0.100. In the evaluation of clinical effectiveness, the machine learning model brought a positive net beneﬁt in the threshold probability of 0\%–90\%, prompting evident competitiveness compare to the other two models. This model has been translated into an online calculator which is accessible freely to the public (https://nkuwangkai-app-formortality-prediction-app-a8mhkf.streamlit.app).

            Improving predictive models for intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients requires a new strategy that periodically includes the latest clinical data and can be updated to reflect local characteristics. We extracted data from all adult patients admitted to the ICUs of two university hospitals with different characteristics from 2006 to 2020, and a total of 85,146 patients were included in this study. Machine learning algorithms were trained to predict in-hospital mortality. The predictive performance of conventional scoring models and machine learning algorithms was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The conventional scoring models had various predictive powers, with the SAPS III (AUROC 0.773 [0.766–0.779] for hospital S) and APACHE III (AUROC 0.803 [0.795–0.810] for hospital G) showing the highest AUROC among them. The best performing machine learning models achieved an AUROC of 0.977 (0.973–0.980) in hospital S and 0.955 (0.950–0.961) in hospital G. The use of ML models in conjunction with conventional scoring systems can provide more useful information for predicting the prognosis of critically ill patients. In this study, we suggest that the predictive model can be made more robust by training with the individual data of each hospital.},

We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-­cause in-­hospital mortality among ICU-­admitted HF patients. Design  A retrospective cohort study. Setting and participants  Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-­ III) database. Data on 1177 heart failure patients were analysed.
Methods  Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were identified from the MIMIC-I­II database and randomly divided into derivation (n=825, 70\%) and a validation (n=352, 30\%) group. Independent risk factors for in-­ hospital mortality were screened using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models in the derivation sample. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build prediction models in derivation group, and then validated in validation cohort. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the predicting model were assessed using the C-­ index, calibration plot and decision curve analysis. After pairwise comparison, the best performing model was chosen to build a nomogram according to the regression coefficients.
Results  Among the 1177 admissions, in-­hospital mortality was 13.52\%. In both groups, the XGBoost, LASSO regression and Get With the Guidelines-­Heart Failure (GWTG-­HF) risk score models showed acceptable discrimination. The XGBoost and LASSO regression models also showed good calibration. In pairwise comparison, the prediction effectiveness was higher with the XGBoost and LASSO regression models than with the GWTG-­HF risk score model (p{\textless}0.05). The XGBoost model was chosen as our final model for its more concise and wider net beneﬁt threshold probability range and was presented as the nomogram.
Conclusions  Our nomogram enabled good prediction of in-­hospital mortality in ICU-­admitted HF patients, which may help clinical decision-­making for such patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Heart failure (HF) is a common disease and a major public health problem. HF mortality prediction is critical for developing individualized prevention and treatment plans. However, due to their lack of interpretability, most HF mortality prediction models have not yet reached clinical practice.
Objective: We aimed to develop an interpretable model to predict the mortality risk for patients with HF in intensive care units (ICUs) and used the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to explain the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and explore prognostic factors for HF.
Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we achieved model development and performance comparison on the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). We extracted data during the first 24 hours of each ICU admission, and the data set was randomly divided, with 70\% used for model training and 30\% used for model validation. The prediction performance of the XGBoost model was compared with three other machine learning models by the area under the curve. We used the SHAP method to explain the XGBoost model.
Results: A total of 2798 eligible patients with HF were included in the final cohort for this study. The observed in-hospital mortality of patients with HF was 9.97\%. Comparatively, the XGBoost model had the highest predictive performance among four models with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.824 (95\% CI 0.7766-0.8708), whereas support vector machine had the poorest generalization ability (AUC=0.701, 95\% CI 0.6433-0.7582). The decision curve showed that the net benefit of the XGBoost model surpassed those of other machine learning models at 10\%{\textasciitilde}28\% threshold probabilities. The SHAP method reveals the top 20 predictors of HF according to the importance ranking, and the average of the blood urea nitrogen was recognized as the most important predictor variable.
Conclusions: The interpretable predictive model helps physicians more accurately predict the mortality risk in ICU patients with HF, and therefore, provides better treatment plans and optimal resource allocation for their patients. In addition, the interpretable framework can increase the transparency of the model and facilitate understanding the reliability of the predictive model for the physicians.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is the final stage of the various heart diseases developing. The mortality rates of prognosis HF patients are highly variable, ranging from 5\% to 75\%. Evaluating the all-cause mortality of HF patients is an important means to avoid death and positively affect the health of patients. But in fact, machine learning models are difficult to gain good results on missing values, high dimensions, and imbalances HF data. Therefore, a deep learning system is proposed. In this system, we propose an indicator vector to indicate whether the value is true or be padded, which fast solves the missing values and helps expand data dimensions. Then, we use a convolutional neural network with different kernel sizes to obtain the features information. And a multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied to gain whole channel information, which is essential for the system to improve performance. Besides, the focal loss function is introduced to deal with the imbalanced problem better. The experimental data of the system are from the public database MIMIC-III, containing valid data for 10311 patients. The proposed system effectively and fast predicts four death types: death within 30 days, death within 180 days, death within 365 days and death after 365 days. Our study uses Deep SHAP to interpret the deep learning model and obtains the top 15 characteristics. These characteristics further confirm the effectiveness and rationality of the system and help
              provide
              a better medical service.},

OBJECTIVE: Determine if the final set of demographic, vital sign, and laboratory data from a hospitalization can be used to accurately quantify 1-year mortality risk. DESIGN: A retrospective study using electronic medical record data linked with the state death registry. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 59,848 hospitalized patients within a six-hospital network over a 4-year period. MAIN MEASURES: The last set of vital signs, complete blood count, basic and complete metabolic panel, demographic information, and ICD codes. The outcome of interest was death within 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Model performance was measured on the validation data set. Random forests (RF) outperformed logisitic regression (LR) models in discriminative ability. An RF model that used the final set of demographic, vitals, and laboratory data from the final 48 h of hospitalization had an AUC of 0.86 (0.85–0.87) for predicting death within a year. Age, blood urea nitrogen, platelet count, hemoglobin, and creatinine were the most important variables in the RF model. Models that used comorbidity variables alone had the lowest AUC. In groups of patients with a high probability of death, RF models underestimated the probability by less than 10\%.
CONCLUSION: The last set of EMR data from a hospitalization can be used to accurately estimate the risk of 1year mortality within a cohort of multicondition hospitalized patients.},

This study aimed to create a new risk prediction model for HF with a minimum number of predictor variables using MLM.

Critical clinical events (CCEs) were defined as death or LV assist device implantation within 1 year from the discharge date. We randomly divided the retrospective data into training and testing datasets and created a risk prediction model based on the training dataset (MLM-risk model). The prediction model was validated using both the testing dataset and the prospectively registered data. Finally, we compared predictive power with published conventional risk models. In the patients with HF (n = 987), CCEs occurred in 142 patients. In the testing dataset, the substantial predictive power of the MLM-risk model was obtained (AUC = 0.87). We generated the model using 15 variables. Our MLM-risk model showed superior predictive power in the prospective study compared to conventional risk models such as the Seattle Heart Failure Model (c-statistics: 0.86 vs. 0.68, p {\textless} 0.05). Notably, the model with an input variable number (n = 5) has comparable predictive power for CCE with the model (variable number = 15).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine-­learning-­based prediction models (MLBPMs) have shown satisfactory performance in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. However, their usefulness has yet to be fully elucidated in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. This pilot study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of MLBPMs in a heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction cohort with long-­term follow-­up data.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 424 patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction were enrolled in our study. The primary outcome was all-­cause mortality. Two feature selection strategies were introduced for MLBPM development. The “All-­in” (67 features) strategy was based on feature correlation, multicollinearity, and clinical significance. The other strategy was the CoxBoost algorithm with 10-­fold cross-­validation (17 features), which was based on the selection result of the “All-­in” strategy. Six MLBPMs with 5-­fold cross-­validation based on the “All-­in” and the CoxBoost algorithm with 10-­fold cross-­ validation strategy were developed by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms. The logistic regression model with 14 benchmark predictors was used as a reference model. During a median follow-­up of 1008 (750, 1937) days, 121 patients met the primary outcome. Overall, MLBPMs outperformed the logistic model. The “All-­in” eXtreme Gradient Boosting model had the best performance, with an accuracy of 85.4\% and a precision of 70.3\%. The area under the receiver-­operating characteristic curve was 0.916 (95\% CI, 0.887–­0.945). The Brier score was 0.12.
CONCLUSIONS: The MLBPMs could significantly improve outcome prediction in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction, which would further optimize the management of these patients.},

              Aims
              Individual risk stratification is a fundamental strategy in managing patients with heart failure (HF). Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), can develop superior models for predicting the prognosis of HF patients, and administrative claim data (ACD) are suitable for ML analysis because ACD is a structured database. The objective of this study was to analyse ACD using an ML algorithm, predict the 1 year mortality of patients with HF, and finally develop an easy‐to‐use prediction model with high accuracy using the top predictors identified by the ML algorithm.
            
            
              Methods and results
              Machine learning‐based prognostic prediction models were developed from the ACD on 10 175 HF patients from the Japanese Registry of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with 17\% mortality during 1 year follow‐up. The top predictors for prognosis in HF were identified by the permutation feature importance technique, and an easy‐to‐use prediction model was developed based on these predictors. The c‐statistics and Brier scores of the developed ML‐based models were compared with those of conventional risk models: Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) and Meta‐Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC). A voting classifier algorithm (ACD‐VC) achieved the highest c‐statistics among the six ML algorithms. The permutation feature importance technique enabled identification of the top predictors such as Barthel index, age, body mass index, duration of hospitalization, last hospitalization, renal disease, and non‐loop diuretics use (feature importance values were 0.054, 0.025, 0.010, 0.005, 0.005, 0.004, and 0.004, respectively). Upon combination of some of the predictors that can be assessed from a brief interview, the Simple Model by ARTificial intelligence for HF risk stratification (SMART‐HF) was established as an easy‐to‐use prediction model. Compared with the conventional models, SMART‐HF achieved a higher c‐statistic \{ACD‐VC: 0.777 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.751–0.803], SMART‐HF: 0.765 [95\% CI 0.739–0.791], SHFM: 0.713 [95\% CI 0.684–0.742], MAGGIC: 0.726 [95\% CI 0.698–0.753]\} and better Brier scores (ACD‐VC: 0.121, SMART‐HF: 0.124, SHFM: 0.139, MAGGIC: 0.130).
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                The ML model based on ACD predicted the 1 year mortality of HF patients with high accuracy, and SMART‐HF along with the ML model achieved superior performance to that of the conventional risk models. The SMART‐HF model has the clear merit of easy operability even by non‐healthcare providers with a user‐friendly online interface (

                ). Risk models developed using SMART‐HF may provide a novel modality for risk stratification of patients with HF.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome commonly caused by any structural or functional impairment. Fast and accurate mortality prediction for Heart Failure is essential to improve the health care of patients and prevent them from death. However, due to the imbalance problem and poor feature representation in Heart Failure data, mortality prediction of Heart Failure is diﬃcult with some simple models. To handle these problems, this study is focused on proposing a fast and accurate Heart Failure mortality prediction framework.
Methods: This paper proposes a feature rearrangement based deep learning system for heart failure mortality prediction. The proposed framework improves the performance of predicting heart failure mortality by handling imbalance problem and achieving better feature representation. This paper also proposes a method named Feature rearrangement based convolutional layer, which demonstrates that the order of the input features is essential for the convolutional network.
Results: The proposed system is experimentally evaluated on real-world Heart Failure data collected from the EHR system of Shanghai Shuguang Hospital, where 10,198 in-patients records are extracted between March 2009 and April 2016. Internal comparison results illustrate that the proposed framework achieves the best performance for Heart Failure mortality prediction. Extensive experimental results compared with other machine learning methods demonstrate that the proposed method has the highest average accuracy and area under the curve while predicting the three goals of in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. Finally, top 12 essential clinical features are mined with their chi-square scores, which can help to assist clinicians in the treatment and research of heart failure.
Conclusions: The proposed method successfully predict different target in three observation windows. Feature rearrangement based convolutional layer and Focal loss are employed into the proposed framework, which helps promote the prediction accuracy of Heart Failure death. The proposed method is fast and accurate for predicting heart failure mortality, especially for imbalance situation. This paper also provide a reasonable pipeline to model EHRs data and handle imbalance problem in medical data.},

Methods: We established six ML models using follow-up data to predict 3-year all-cause mortality. Through comprehensive evaluation, the best performing model was used to predict and stratify patients. The log-rank test was used to assess the difference between Kaplan–Meier curves. The association between ML risk and 3-year allcause mortality was also assessed using multivariable Cox regression. Finally, an explainable approach based on ML and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was deployed to calculate 3-year all-cause mortality risk and to generate individual explanations of the model’s decisions.
Results: The best performing extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was selected to predict and stratify patients. Subjects with a higher ML score had a high hazard of suffering events (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.351; P {\textless} 0.001), and this relationship persisted with a multivariable analysis (adjusted HR: 5.343; P {\textless} 0.001). Age, Nterminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, occupation, New York Heart Association classification, and nitrate drug use were important factors for both genders.
Conclusions: The ML-based risk stratification tool was able to accurately assess and stratify the risk of 3-year allcause mortality in patients with HF caused by CHD. ML combined with SHAP could provide an explicit expla­ nation of individualized risk prediction and give physicians an intuitive understanding of the influence of key features in the model.},

            With over 17 million annual deaths, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) dominate the cause of death statistics. CVDs can deteriorate the quality of life drastically and even cause sudden death, all the while inducing massive healthcare costs. This work studied state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to predict increased risk of death in CVD patients, building on the electronic health records (EHR) of over 23,000 cardiac patients. Taking into account the usefulness of the prediction for chronic disease patients, a prediction period of six months was selected. Two major transformer models that rely on learning bidirectional dependencies in sequential data, BERT and XLNet, were trained and compared. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first to apply XLNet on EHR data to predict mortality. The patient histories were formulated as time series consisting of varying types of clinical events, thus enabling the model to learn increasingly complex temporal dependencies. BERT and XLNet achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 75.5\% and 76.0\%, respectively. XLNet surpassed BERT in recall by 9.8\%, suggesting that it captures more positive cases than BERT, which is the main focus of recent research on EHRs and transformers.},

	abstract = {Integrating Machine Learning (ML) in medicine has unlocked many opportunities to harness complex medical data, enhancing patient outcomes and advancing the field. However, the inherent imbalanced distribution of medical data poses a significant challenge, resulting in biased ML models that perform poorly on minority classes. Mitigating the impact of class imbalance has prompted researchers to explore various strategies, wherein CostSensitive Learning (CSL) arises as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and reliability of ML models. This paper presents the first review of CSL for imbalanced medical data. A comprehensive exploration of the existing literature encompassed papers published from January 2010 to December 2022 and sourced from five major digital libraries. A total of 173 papers were selected, analysed, and classified based on key criteria, including publication years, channels and sources, research types, empirical types, medical sub-fields, medical tasks, CSL approaches, strengths and weaknesses of CSL, frequently used datasets and data types, evaluation metrics, and development tools. The results indicate a noteworthy publication rise, particularly since 2020, and a strong preference for CSL direct approaches. Data type analysis unveiled diverse modalities, with medical images prevailing. The underutilisation of cost-related metrics and the prevalence of Python as the primary programming tool are highlighted. The strengths and weaknesses analysis covered three aspects: CSL strategy, CSL approaches, and relevant works. This study serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to explore the current state of research, identify strengths and gaps in the existing literature and advance CSL’s application for imbalanced medical data.},

	abstract = {Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a clinical syndrome characterised by symptoms and signs due to structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart. CHF confers risk for cardiovascular deterioration events which cause recurrent hospitalisations and high mortality rates. The early prediction of these events is very important to limit serious consequences, improve the quality of care, and reduce its burden. CHF is a progressive condition in which patients may remain asymptomatic before the onset of symptoms, as observed in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The early detection of underlying causes is critical for treatment optimisation and prognosis improvement. To develop models to predict cardiovascular deterioration events in patients with chronic heart failure, a real dataset was constructed and a knowledge discovery task was implemented in this study. The dataset is imbalanced, as it is common in real-world applications. It thus posed a challenge because imbalanced datasets tend to be overwhelmed by the abundance of majority-class instances during the learning process. To address the issue, a pipeline was developed speciﬁcally to handle imbalanced data. Different predictive models were developed and compared. To enhance sensitivity and other performance metrics, we employed multiple approaches, including data resampling, cost-sensitive methods, and a hybrid method that combines both techniques. These methods were utilised to assess the predictive capabilities of the models and their effectiveness in handling imbalanced data. By using these metrics, we aimed to identify the most effective strategies for achieving improved model performance in real scenarios with imbalanced datasets. The best model for predicting cardiovascular events achieved mean a sensitivity 65\%, a mean speciﬁcity 55\%, and a mean area under the curve of 0.71. The results show that cost-sensitive models combined with over/under sampling approaches are effective for the meaningful prediction of cardiovascular events in CHF patients.},

ROC analysis can be used for diagnostic tests with outcomes measured on ordinal, interval or ratio scales. The dependence of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on the selected cut-off value must be considered for a full test evaluation and for test comparison. All possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity that can be achieved by changing the test's cutoff value can be summarised using a single parameter; the area under the ROC curve. The ROC technique can also be used to optimise cut-off values with regard to a given prevalence in the target population and cost ratio of false-positive and false-negative results. However, plots of optimisation parameters against the selected cut-off value provide a more-direct method for cut-off selection. Candidates for such optimisation parameters are linear combinations of sensitivity and specificity (with weights selected to reflect the decision-making situation), odds ratio, chance-corrected measures of association (e.g. kappa) and likelihood ratios. We discuss some recent developments in ROC analysis, including meta-analysis of diagnostic tests, correlated ROC curves (paired-sample design) and chance- and prevalence-corrected ROC curves. \# 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {The decision curve is a graphical summary recently proposed for assessing the potential clinical impact of risk prediction biomarkers or risk models for recommending treatment or intervention. It was applied recently in an article in Journal of Clinical Oncology to measure the impact of using a genomic risk model for deciding on adjuvant radiation therapy for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. We illustrate the use of decision curves for evaluating clinical- and biomarkerbased models for predicting a man’s risk of prostate cancer, which could be used to guide the decision to biopsy. Decision curves are grounded in a decision-theoretical framework that accounts for both the beneﬁts of intervention and the costs of intervention to a patient who cannot beneﬁt. Decision curves are thus an improvement over purely mathematical measures of performance such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, there are challenges in using and interpreting decision curves appropriately. We caution that decision curves cannot be used to identify the optimal risk threshold for recommending intervention. We discuss the use of decision curves for miscalibrated risk models. Finally, we emphasize that a decision curve shows the performance of a risk model in a population in which every patient has the same expected beneﬁt and cost of intervention. If every patient has a personal beneﬁt and cost, then the curves are not useful. If subpopulations have different beneﬁts and costs, subpopulation-speciﬁc decision curves should be used. As a companion to this article, we released an R software package called DecisionCurve for making decision curves and related graphics.},

Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method. The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the “decision curve.” The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion. Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

	abstract = {Aim Heart failure (HF) is predominantly a disorder of the elderly. During the last decades, cardiovascular primary and secondary prevention and life expectancy have improved. Accordingly, trends in incidence and prevalence of HF are dynamic and may differ over time by age and gender. We aim to investigate the overall and age-specific and sex-specific trends, in incidence, prevalence, and the proportion with co-morbidities of HF over a 10 year period in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. Methods and results The VEGA database is an administrative database of all patients managed in hospital and/or in primary care (private and public) living in Region Västra Götaland. All patients with a main or contributory diagnosis of HF (I50) aged 18 years or older between 2008 and 2017 were included. Incidence and prevalence of HF were calculated based on the entire adult population of Region Västra Götaland. The adult population in Region Västra Götaland increased by 8\% from 2008 (n = 1 234 609) to 2017 (n = 1 338 906). Half the population was female and 69\% {\textless} 60 years of age, both constant over time. In total, 62 228 incident cases of HF were identified. In 2008, we identified 6464 cases, mean age 78.7 (11.5) years, and 49.8\% (n = 3222) men, while in 2017, 5727 cases were identified, mean age 78.3 (11.8) years, and 52.5\% (n = 3006) men. The overall yearly incidence rate of HF decreased by 3\%, RR 0.97 (95\% CI 0.96–0.97) per year, P {\textless} 0.0001, mainly driven by the age categories {\textgreater}75 years. A constantly higher incidence of HF was seen for men compared with women in all age categories, RR 1.46 (95\% CI 1.44–1.49), P {\textless} 0.0001. During the same period, we observed a steady increase in overall prevalence from 1.8\% for women and 2.0\% for men in 2008, to 2.4\% in women and 2.8\% in men in 2017, particularly in those {\textgreater}85 years of age who had a prevalence of 16.5\% (men) and 14.6\% (women) in 2008 and 23.5\% (men) and 21.5\% (women) in 2017. The overall 1 year mortality rate was 22.7\%. When adjusted for age, women had a lower risk for death by 13\% compared with men [hazard ratio 0.87 (95\% CI 0.84–0.90, P {\textless} 0.0001)]. Conclusion We saw a decrease in overall incidence, but incidence of HF remains high, particularly in the oldest age groups. Prevalence of HF keeps increasing particularly in those aged {\textgreater}85 years. Our findings emphasize the need for implementation of effective preventive strategies for HF.},

	abstract = {Two in 5 US hospital stays result in rehabilitative postacute care, typically through skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or home health agencies (HHAs). However, a lack of clear guidelines and understanding of patient and caregiver preferences make it challenging to promote high-value patient-centered care.To assess preferences and willingness to pay for facility-based vs home-based postacute care among patients and caregivers, considering demographic variations.In September 2022, a nationally representative survey was conducted with participants 45 years or older. Using a discrete choice experiment, participants acting as patients or caregivers chose between facility-based and home-based postacute care that best met their preferences, needs, and family conditions. Survey weights were applied to generate nationally representative estimates.Preferences and willingness to pay for various attributes of postacute care settings were assessed, examining variation based on demographic factors, socioeconomic status, job security, and previous care experiences.A total of 2077 adults were invited to participate in the survey; 1555 (74.9\%) completed the survey. In the weighted sample, 52.9\% of participants were women, 6.5\% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.7\% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 11.2\% were Black or African American, 78.4\% were White; the mean (SD) age was 62.6 (9.6) years; and there was a survey completion rate of 74.9\%. Patients and caregivers showed a substantial willingness to pay for home-based and high-quality care. Patients and caregivers were willing to pay an additional \$58.08 per day (95\% CI, 45.32-70.83) and \$45.54 per day (95\% CI, 31.09-59.99) for HHA care compared with a shared SNF room, respectively. However, increased demands on caregiver time within an HHA scenario and socioeconomic challenges, such as insecure employment, shifted caregivers’ preferences toward facility-based care. There was a strong aversion to below average quality. To avoid below average SNF care, patients and caregivers were willing to pay \$75.21 per day (95\% CI, 61.68-88.75) and \$79.10 per day (95\% CI, 63.29-94.91) compared with average-quality care, respectively. Additionally, prior awareness and experience with postacute care was associated with willingness to pay for home-based care. No differences in preferences among patients and caregivers based on race, educational background, urban or rural residence, general health status, or housing type were observed.The findings of this survey study underscore a prevailing preference for home-based postacute care, aligning with current policy trends. However, attention is warranted for disadvantaged groups who are potentially overlooked during the shift toward home-based care, particularly those facing caregiver constraints and socioeconomic hardships. Ensuring equitable support and improved quality measure tools are crucial for promoting patient-centric postacute care, with emphasis on addressing the needs of marginalized groups.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients with heart failure (HF) experience recurrent hospitalizations and may prefer a Hospital at Home (HaH) model over routine hospitalization.
Methods
We administered a 9-item questionnaire on perceived effectiveness, safety, convenience, and acceptability of a HaH model among patients hospitalized for HF at 2 academic hospitals in Ontario. The primary outcome was HaH care acceptability, defined as a preference for or neutrality to HaH care over routine hospitalization. We used partial Spearman rank correlations (ρ) and multivariable logistic regression analyses to explore associations with outcomes.
Results
Of 297 eligible patients, 269 (90.6\%) completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 76.2 (standard deviation, 12.3) years; 48.3\% were female; and 70.5\% lived in their own home, commonly with a relative or caregiver (67.9\%). As many as 211 patients (78.4\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 73.0\%-83.2\%) found HaH care acceptable, with 169 (62.8\%; 95\% CI, 56.8\%-68.6\%) preferring HaH care over routine hospitalization. Perceived convenience (ρ, 0.57; P {\textless} 0.001) and safety (ρ, 0.37; p {\textless} 0.001) were associated with HaH acceptability, whereas perceived effectiveness was not (ρ, 0.14; P = 0.021). A college (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.96; 95\% CI, 2.01-17.62; P = 0.001) or university (aOR, 3.58; 95\% CI, 1.07-12.06; P = 0.039) education was associated with greater odds of HaH acceptability, whereas residing in a caregiver’s home was associated with lower odds (aOR, 0.34; 95\% CI 0.14-0.84; P = 0.019).
Conclusions
A majority of patients with HF perceived HaH care to be an acceptable alternative to routine hospitalization, prioritizing perceived convenience and safety over effectiveness. Postsecondary education and living independently without caregiver support were associated with HaH acceptability.
Résumé
Introduction
Puisque les patients atteints d’insuffisance cardiaque (IC) sont hospitalisés à répétition, ils peuvent préférer le modèle d’hospitalisation à domicile (HAD) à l’hospitalisation habituelle.
Méthodes
Nous avons fait passer un questionnaire de neuf items sur l’efficacité, la sécurité, la commodité et l’acceptabilité perçues du modèle d’HAD aux patients hospitalisés atteints d’IC de deux hôpitaux universitaires de l’Ontario. Le critère de jugement principal était l’acceptabilité des soins en HAD, définie par la préférence ou la neutralité à l’égard des soins en HAD plutôt qu’à l’égard de l’hospitalisation habituelle. Nous avons utilisé les corrélations partielles sur les rangs de Spearman (ρ) et les analyses multivariées de régression logistique pour examiner les associations avec les résultats.
Résultats
Au sein des 297 patients admissibles, 269 (90,6 \%) ont rempli le questionnaire. L’âge moyen était de 76,2 (écart type, 12,3) ans; 48,3 \% étaient des femmes et 70,5 \% vivaient dans leur propre maison, généralement avec un parent ou un soignant (67,9 \%). Jusqu’à 211 patients (78,4 \%; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 \%, 73,0 \%-83,2 \%) trouvaient les soins en HAD acceptables : 169 (62,8 \%; IC à 95 \%, 56,8 \%-68,6 \%) préféraient les soins en HAD à l’hospitalisation habituelle. La commodité (ρ, 0,57; P {\textless} 0,001) et la sécurité perçues (ρ, 0,37; p {\textless} 0,001) étaient associées à l’acceptabilité de l’HAD, tandis que l’efficacité perçue ne l’était pas (ρ, 0,14; P = 0,021). Une formation collégiale (ratio d’incidence ajusté [RIAa], 5,96; IC à 95 \%, 2,01-17,62; P = 0,001) ou universitaire (RIAa, 3,58; IC à 95 \%, 1,07-12,06; P = 0,039) était associée à une plus grande probabilité d’acceptabilité de l’HAD, tandis que le fait de vivre au domicile du soignant était associé à une plus faible probabilité (RIAa, 0,34; IC à 95 \%, 0,14-0,84; P = 0,019).
Conclusions
Une majorité de patients atteints d’IC considéraient que les soins en HAD étaient une alternative acceptable à l’hospitalisation habituelle, et accordaient la priorité à la commodité et à la sécurité perçues plutôt qu’à l’efficacité. La formation postsecondaire et le fait de vivre de façon indépendante sans l’aide d’un soignant étaient associés à l’acceptabilité de l’HAD.},
