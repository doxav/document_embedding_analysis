               presence of atrioventricular accessory pathways, predisposing to
               arrhythmias. Although it is well established that risk
               stratification in symptomatic patients should be invasive, there
               is a lack of evidence of the benefit in asymptomatic. OBJECTIVE:
               Evaluate ventricular pre-excitation in the electrocardiogram
               (ECG) as a risk factor for overall mortality in patients of
               Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), Brazil. METHODS: This
               observational study was developed with the database of digital
               ECGs (2010-2017) from TNMG. The electronic cohort was obtained by
               linking data from ECG exams and those from the national mortality
               information system. Only the first ECG was considered. Clinical
               data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted manually by
               cardiologists and automatically by the Glasgow University
               Interpreter software. Hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was
               estimated using weighted Cox regression. RESULTS: Nearly 1 665
               667 patients were included (median age: 50 [Q1: 34; Q3: 63]
               years; 41.4\% were male). In a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the
               overall mortality rate was 3.1\%. The prevalence of ventricular
               pre-excitation was 0.07\%. In multivariate analysis, adjusting
               for sex and age, ventricular pre-excitation was not associated
               with an increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.41; 95\% confidence
               interval [CI]: 0.56-3.57; p = .47) when compared to the whole
               sample or to patients with normal ECG (HR: 1.41; 95\% CI:
               0.53-4.36; p = .43). In a subanalysis on accessory pathway
               location, there was no evidence of a higher risk of death related
               to any location. CONCLUSION: Ventricular pre-excitation was not
               associated with an increased risk of mortality in a primary care

  abstract = "Aims: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health problem and its
              prevalence is increasing worldwide. Electronic cohorts, with large
              electrocardiogram (ECG) databases linked to mortality data, can be
              useful in determining prognostic value of ECG abnormalities. Our
              aim is to evaluate the risk of mortality in patients with AF from
              Brazil. Methods: This observational retrospective study of primary
              care patients was developed with the digital ECG database from the
              Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil. ECGs performed from
              2010 to 2017 were interpreted by cardiologists and the University
              of Glasgow automated analysis software. An electronic cohort was
              obtained linking data from ECG exams and those from a national
              mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage
              methods. We considered only the first ECG of each patient.
              Patients under 16 years were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for
              mortality were adjusted for demographic and self-reported clinical
              factors and estimated with Cox regression. Results: From a dataset
              of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean age 51.6
              years; 40.2\% male. There were 3.34\% deaths from all causes in
              3.68 years of median follow up. The prevalence of AF was 1.33\%.
              AF was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR
              2.10, 95\%CI 2.03-2.17) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.06,
              95\%CI 1.86-2.29). Females with AF had a higher risk of overall
              and cardiovascular mortality compared with males (p < 0.001).
              Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular and
              all-cause mortality in a primary care population, with increased
              risk in women. Condensed abstract: To assess risk of mortality in
              AF patients, an electronic cohort was obtained linking data from
              ECG exams of Brazilian primary care patients and a national
              mortality information system. From 1,558,421 patients, AF
              (prevalence 1.33\%) carried a higher risk of overall and
              cardiovascular mortality, with increased risk in women. What’s
              New: This is the first study with a large Brazilian electronic
              cohort to evaluate the risk of mortality linked to AF in primary
              care patients.AF patients from a Brazilian primary care population
              had a higher risk of death for all causes (HR 2.10, 95\%CI
              2.03-2.17) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.06, 95\%CI
              1.86-2.29).Female patients with AF had an increased risk of

               modern electrocardiographic and ECG reading technology. METHODS
               AND RESULTS: The results of ECG interpretation by cardiologists
               using digital technology for viewing and interpreting ECGs were
               compiled from single, baseline ECGs of 79,743 individuals
               included in pharmaceutical company-sponsored clinical trials.
               Women comprised 48\% of the total population. Ages ranged from 3
               months to 99 years, and the bulk of the population (56\%) was
               aged 40 to 70 years. Striking differences in numerical ECG values
               based on age and sex were observed. A subgroup of 46,129
               individuals with a very low probability of cardiovascular disease
               was identified. The following were the reference ranges for this
               subgroup, determined using the 2nd and 98th percentiles: heart
               rate, 48 to 98 beats/min; PR interval, 113 to 212 milliseconds;
               QRS interval, 69 to 109 milliseconds; frontal plane QRS axis, -40
               degrees to 91 degrees ; QT interval, 325 to 452 milliseconds;
               QTc-Bazett, 361 to 457 milliseconds; and QTc-Fridericia, 359 to
               445 milliseconds. There were marked age- and sex-related
               variations in the reference ranges of this subgroup, and they
               differ substantially from previously reported norms. Small
               differences were observed in ECG values obtained using our
               digital methods as compared with readings done using paper
               tracings and values computed by 2 commercial computer algorithms.
               CONCLUSIONS: We observed large differences in
               electrocardiographic heart rate, interval, and axis reference
               ranges in this study compared with those reported previously and
               with reference ranges in general use. We also observed a large
               influence of age and sex upon normal values. Very large cohorts
               are required to fully assess age- and sex-related variation of
               reference ranges. Electrocardiographic reference ranges should be

              schemes used in clinical trials such as the Minnesota Code rely on
              independent classification of the baseline and each follow-up or
              acute event ECG, whereby graded changes in the hierarchic severity
              level of the code signify new events such as myocardial infarction
              (MI). This approach suffers from classification errors caused by
              repeated instability at decision boundaries at each step when the
              baseline and each acute event ECG is classified, and various
              ``verification rules'' must be used at the end of the coding
              process to prevent trivial serial changes from causing large
              transitions in coded events. The NOVACODE algorithms for visual
              and computer coding of serial ECGs were designed to alleviate some
              of these instability problems by quantifying changes in critical
              waveform patterns on a continuous scale. This is achieved by
              determining, for each ECG coded, a Q-QS Score, ST Depression
              Score, ST Elevation Score and T-Wave Score, each ranging from 0 to
              50. In the next step, a score is derived for ST-T evolution and

              To counter this, we introduce HuBERT-ECG, a novel self-supervised

              diagnosing diseases to predicting future cardiovascular events.
              Across diverse real-world scenarios, HuBERT-ECG achieves AUROCs
              from 0.843 on small datasets to 0.99 on larger sources. When

               be used to predict future cardiovascular disease and mortality
               and have phenotypic and genotypic associations. METHODS: We
               extracted 5120 neural network-derived ECG features from an
               artificial intelligence-enabled ECG model trained for 6 simple
               diagnoses and applied unsupervised machine learning to identify 3
               phenogroups. Using the identified phenogroups, we externally
               validated our findings in 5 diverse cohorts from the United
               States, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. Data were collected

               included in this study. In the derivation cohort, the 3
               phenogroups had significantly different mortality profiles. After
               adjusting for known covariates, phenogroup B had a 20\% increase
               in long-term mortality compared with phenogroup A (hazard ratio,
               1.20 [95\% CI, 1.17-1.23]; P<0.0001; phenogroup A mortality,
               2.2\%; phenogroup B mortality, 6.1\%). In univariate analyses, we
               found phenogroup B had a significantly greater risk of mortality
               in all cohorts (log-rank P<0.01 in all 5 cohorts). Phenome-wide
               association study showed phenogroup B had a higher rate of future
               atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 2.89; P<0.00001), ventricular
               tachycardia (odds ratio, 2.00; P<0.00001), ischemic heart disease

               2.04; P<0.00001). A single-trait genome-wide association study
               yielded 4 loci. SCN10A, SCN5A, and CAV1 have roles in cardiac

               This practice, however, generates large amounts of data, the
               analysis of which requires considerable time and effort by human
               experts. Advancement of modern machine learning and statistical
               tools can be trained on high quality, large data to achieve
               exceptional levels of automated diagnostic accuracy. Thus, we
               collected and disseminated this novel database that contains
               12-lead ECGs of 10,646 patients with a 500 Hz sampling rate that
               features 11 common rhythms and 67 additional cardiovascular
               conditions, all labeled by professional experts. The dataset
               consists of 10-second, 12-dimension ECGs and labels for rhythms
               and other conditions for each subject. The dataset can be used to
               design, compare, and fine-tune new and classical statistical and
               machine learning techniques in studies focused on arrhythmia and
               other cardiovascular conditions.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Left bundle branch block is recognized as a marker of
              higher risk of death, but the prognostic value of the right bundle
              branch block in the general population is still controversial. Our
              aim is to evaluate the risk of overall and cardiovascular
              mortality in patients with right (RBBB) and left bundle branch
              block (LBBB) in a large electronic cohort of Brazilian patients.
              METHODS: This observational retrospective study was developed with
              the database of digital ECGs from Telehealth Network of Minas
              Gerais, Brazil (TNMG). All ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 in
              primary care patients over 16 years old were assessed. The
              electronic cohort was obtained by linking data from ECG exams
              (name, sex, date of birth, city of residence) and those from
              national mortality information system, using standard
              probabilistic linkage methods (FRIL: Fine-grained record linkage
              software, v.2.1.5, Atlanta, GA). Only the first ECG of each
              patient was considered. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs
              were interpreted manually by cardiologists and automatically by
              the Glasgow University Interpreter software. Hazard ratio (HR) for
              mortality was estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: From a
              dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 primary care patients
              over 16 years old underwent a valid ECG recording during 2010 to
              2017. We excluded 17,359 patients that didn't have a valid QRS
              measure from the Glasgow program and 11,091 patients from the
              control group that had QRS equal or above 120 ms and were not RBBB
              or LBBB. Therefore, 1,529,971 were included (median age 52 [Q1:38;
              Q3:65] years; 40.2\% were male). In a mean follow-up of 3.7 years,
              the overall mortality rate was 3.34\%. RBBB was more frequent
              (2.42\%) than LBBB (1.32\%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting
              for sex, age and comorbidities, both patients with RBBB (HR 1.32;
              CI 95\% 1.27-1.37) and LBBB (HR 1.69; CI 95\% 1.62-1.76) had
              higher risk of overall mortality. Women with RBBB had an increased
              risk of all-cause death compared to men (p < 0.001).
              Cardiovascular mortality was higher in patients with LBBB (HR
              1.77; CI 95\% 1.55-2.01), but not for RBBB. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
              with RBBB and LBBB had higher risk of overall mortality. Women
              with RBBB had more risk of all-cause death than men. LBBB was
              associated with higher risk of cardiovascular mortality.",

  abstract = "Summary Background Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic
              and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart
              failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged
              monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to
              develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying
              patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. Methods
              We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
              electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to
              detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation
              present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second,
              12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with
              at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second,
              12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG
              laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm
              labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist
              supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a
              rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for
              atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal
              validation, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. We calculated
              the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring
              characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select
              a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset.
              We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by
              calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
              and F1 score with two-sided 95\% CIs. Findings We included 180 922
              patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454
              789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset,
              64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation
              dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing
              dataset. 3051 (8·4\%) patients in the testing dataset had verified
              atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by
              the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation
              with an AUC of 0·87 (95\% CI 0·86–0·88), sensitivity of 79·0\%
              (77·5–80·4), specificity of 79·5\% (79·0–79·9), F1 score of 39·2\%
              (38·1–40·3), and overall accuracy of 79·4\% (79·0–79·9). Including
              all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window
              of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first
              recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0·90
              (0·90–0·91), sensitivity to 82·3\% (80·9–83·6), specificity to
              83·4\% (83·0–83·8), F1 score to 45·4\% (44·2–46·5), and overall
              accuracy to 83·3\% (83·0–83·7). Interpretation An AI-enabled ECG
              acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at
              point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. Funding

               diagnostic procedure and its interpretation is increasingly
               supported by algorithms. The progress in the field of automatic
               ECG analysis has up to now been hampered by a lack of appropriate
               datasets for training as well as a lack of well-defined
               evaluation procedures to ensure comparability of different
               algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we put forward first
               benchmarking results for the recently published, freely
               accessible clinical 12-lead ECG dataset PTB-XL, covering a
               variety of tasks from different ECG statement prediction tasks to
               age and sex prediction. Among the investigated
               deep-learning-based timeseries classification algorithms, we find
               that convolutional neural networks, in particular resnet- and
               inception-based architectures, show the strongest performance
               across all tasks. We find consistent results on the ICBEB2018
               challenge ECG dataset and discuss prospects of transfer learning
               using classifiers pretrained on PTB-XL. These benchmarking
               results are complemented by deeper insights into the
               classification algorithm in terms of hidden stratification, model
               uncertainty and an exploratory interpretability analysis, which
               provide connecting points for future research on the dataset. Our
               results emphasize the prospects of deep-learning-based algorithms
               in the field of ECG analysis, not only in terms of quantitative
               accuracy but also in terms of clinically equally important
               further quality metrics such as uncertainty quantification and
               interpretability. With this resource, we aim to establish the
               PTB-XL dataset as a resource for structured benchmarking of ECG

              led to vast amounts of ECG data that currently need to be
              interpreted by human technicians. Here we tested an artificial
              intelligence (AI) algorithm for direct-to-physician reporting of
              ambulatory ECGs. Beat-by-beat annotation of 14,606 individual
              ambulatory ECG recordings (mean duration = 14 ± 10 days) was
              performed by certified ECG technicians (n = 167) and an ensemble
              AI model, called DeepRhythmAI. To compare the performance of the
              AI model and the technicians, a random sample of 5,235 rhythm
              events identified by the AI model or by technicians, of which
              2,236 events were identified as critical arrhythmias, was selected
              for annotation by one of 17 cardiologist consensus panels. The
              mean sensitivity of the AI model for the identification of
              critical arrhythmias was 98.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) =
              97.7-99.4), as compared to 80.3\% (95\% CI = 77.3-83.3\%) for the
              technicians. False-negative findings were observed in 3.2/1,000
              patients for the AI model versus 44.3/1,000 patients for the
              technicians. Accordingly, the relative risk of a missed diagnosis
              was 14.1 (95\% CI = 10.4-19.0) times higher for the technicians.
              However, a higher false-positive event rate was observed for the
              AI model (12 (interquartile range (IQR) = 6-74)/1,000 patient
              days) as compared to the technicians (5 (IQR = 2-153)/1,000
              patient days). We conclude that the DeepRhythmAI model has
              excellent negative predictive value for critical arrhythmias,
              substantially reducing false-negative findings, but at a modest
              cost of increased false-positive findings. AI-only analysis to
              facilitate direct-to-physician reporting could potentially reduce
              costs and improve access to care and outcomes in patients who need
              ambulatory ECG monitoring.",

                   diagnosis of arrhythmias and other heart diseases, but deep
                   learning methods based on ECG often face limitations due to
                   the need for high-quality annotations. Although previous ECG
                   self-supervised learning (eSSL) methods have made significant
                   progress in representation learning from unannotated ECG
                   data, they typically treat ECG signals as ordinary
                   time-series data, segmenting the signals using fixed-size and
                   fixed-step time windows, which often ignore the form and
                   rhythm characteristics and latent semantic relationships in
                   ECG signals. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective
                   on ECG signals, treating heartbeats as words and rhythms as
                   sentences. Based on this perspective, we first designed the
                   QRS-Tokenizer, which generates semantically meaningful ECG
                   sentences from the raw ECG signals. Building on these, we
                   then propose HeartLang, a novel self-supervised learning
                   framework for ECG language processing, learning general
                   representations at form and rhythm levels. Additionally, we
                   construct the largest heartbeat-based ECG vocabulary to date,
                   which will further advance the development of ECG language
                   processing. We evaluated HeartLang across six public ECG
                   datasets, where it demonstrated robust competitiveness
                   against other eSSL methods. Our data and code are publicly

              (ECG-age) can be a measure of cardiovascular health. A deep neural
              network is trained to predict a patient's age from the 12-lead ECG
              in the CODE study cohort (n = 1,558,415 patients). On a 15\%
              hold-out split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years greater
              than the chronological age have a higher mortality rate (hazard
              ratio (HR) 1.79, p < 0.001), whereas those with ECG-age more than
              8 years smaller, have a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p < 0.001).
              Similar results are obtained in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil

              patients have abnormal ECGs. No studies have assessed the
              reference standards for a Latin American population. Our aim was
              to establish the normal ranges of the ECG for pediatric and adult
              Brazilian primary care patients. METHODS: This retrospective
              observational study assessed all the consecutive 12-lead digital
              electrocardiograms of primary care patients at least 1 year old in
              Minas Gerais state, Brazil, recorded between 2010 and 2015. ECGs
              were excluded if there were technical problems, selected
              abnormalities were present or patients with selected self-declared
              comorbidities or on drug therapy. Only the first ECG from patients
              with multiple ECGs was accepted. The University of Glasgow ECG
              analysis program was used to automatically interpret the ECGs. For
              each variable, the 1st, 2nd, 50th, 98th and 99th percentiles were
              determined and results were compared to selected studies. RESULTS:
              A total of 1,493,905 ECGs were recorded. 1,007,891 were excluded
              and 486.014 were analyzed. This large study provided normal values
              for heart rate, P, QRS and T frontal axis, P and QRS overall
              duration, PR and QT overall intervals and QTc corrected by Hodges,
              Bazett, Fridericia and Framingham formulae. Overall, the results
              were similar to those from other studies performed in different
              populations but there were differences in extreme ages and
              specific measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided
              reference values for Latinos of both sexes older than 1 year. Our
              results are comparable to studies performed in different
              populations.",

               established in 2005 to provide telecardiology support to primary
               healthcare teams. Positive outcomes led to its expansion.
               Currently, the TNMG provides telecardiology support for 14 out of
               the 27 states and 1320 municipalities in Brazil, 72.1\% of those
               with up to 20 000 inhabitants. Between 2006 and 2024, more than 9
               million ECG reports were issued by the TNMG. Operational aspects
               include 24/7 availability, with elective ECG reports issued in a
               median of 41 min 30 s (Q1=6 min 44 s, Q3=1 h 32 min 24 s) and
               emergency reports in 47 s (Q1=22 s, Q3=1 min 55 s). Clinical
               alerts notify urgent conditions, facilitating timely
               interventions. Synchronous eConsults service support local
               primary care-based physicians, promoting collaborative care.
               TNMG's telecardiology system has facilitated scientific and
               technological advancements, including machine learning
               applications for ECG interpretation and prognostic implications.
               International collaborations have expanded, with ongoing projects

               comprised 15,105 participants (35-74 years) from six Brazilian
               capitals. OBJECTIVES: To describe electrocardiographic findings
               in Brazilian adults without heart disease, stratified by sex, age
               and race/skin color. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with baseline
               data of 11,094 adults (44.5\% men) without heart disease from
               ELSA-Brasil. The ECGs were recorded with the Burdick Atria 6100
               machine and stored at the Pyramis System. ECG analysis was

               descriptive analysis of heart rate (HR), P, QRS and T waves'
               duration, PR and QT intervals, and P, R and T axes was performed.
               After stratification by sex, race/color and age, the groups were
               compared by the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis test at a
               significance level of 5\%. Linear regression models were used to
               evaluate the behavior of electrocardiographic parameters over
               age. Major electrocardiographic abnormalities defined by the
               Minnesota code were manually revised. RESULTS: Medians values of
               the electrocardiographic parameters were different between men
               and women: HR 63 vs. 66 bpm, PR 164 vs.158 ms, QT corrected 410

               108 ms, P-wave axis 54 vs. 57 degrees, R-wave axis 35 vs. 39
               degrees, T-wave axis 39 vs. 45 degrees (p < 0.001 for all). The
               2nd and the 98th percentiles of each variable were also obtained,
               and graphs were constructed to illustrate the behavior of the
               electrocardiographic findings over age of participants stratified
               by sex and race/skin color. CONCLUSIONS: The values for the
               electrocardiographic measurements herein described can be used as
               reference for Brazilian adults free of heart disease, stratified
               by sex. Our results suggest that self-reported race/skin color

               normal values for the clinically current measurements in the
               adult ECG, covering all ages for both sexes. METHODS: The study
               population included 13,354 individuals, taken from four
               population studies in The Netherlands, ranging in age from 16 to
               90 years (55\% men) and cardiologically healthy by commonly
               accepted criteria. Standard 12-lead ECGs were available for all
               participants. The ECGs were processed by a well-validated
               computer program. Normal limits were taken as the 2nd and 98th
               percentiles of the measurement distribution per age group.
               RESULTS: Our study corroborates many findings of previous
               studies, but also provides more differentiated results, in
               particular for the older age groups. Age trends were apparent for
               the QTc interval, QRS axis, and indices of left ventricular
               hypertrophy. Amplitudes in the left precordial leads showed a
               substantial increase in the older age groups for women, but not
               for men. Sex-dependent differences were apparent for most ECG
               parameters. All results are available on the Website
               www.normalecg.org, both in tabular and in graphical format.
               CONCLUSIONS: We determined age- and sex-dependent normal values
               of the adult ECG. Our study distinguishes itself from other
               studies by the large size of the study population, comprising
               both sexes, the broad range of ages, and the exhaustive set of
               measurements. Our results emphasize that most diagnostic ECG
               criteria should be age- and sex-specific.",

                   crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical
                   practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods
                   show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG
                   data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be
                   found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for
                   annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's
                   versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the
                   Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL) framework.
                   Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated
                   reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG
                   classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for
                   training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose
                   the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE)
                   approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit
                   external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases,
                   generating more descriptive prompts and reducing
                   hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot
                   classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark
                   across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior
                   performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably,
                   MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2\% in zero-shot
                   classification (without training data), 3.2\% higher than
                   linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data,

                  sleep monitoring, making ECG analysis critically essential.
                  Traditional deep learning models for ECG are task-specific,
                  with a narrow scope of functionality and limited
                  generalization capabilities. Recently, foundation models
                  (FMs), also known as large pre-training models, have
                  fundamentally reshaped the scheme of model design and
                  representation learning, enhancing the performance across a
                  variety of downstream tasks. This success has drawn interest
                  in the exploration of FMs to address ECG-based medical
                  challenges concurrently. This survey provides a timely,
                  comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for large-scale

              clinical course of AVB has been evaluated, the findings are from
              high-income countries and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated to
              the Latinx population. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between
              AVB and mortality. METHODS: Patients from the CODE (Clinical
              Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study, older than 16 years
              who underwent digital electrocardiogram (ECG) from 2010 to 2017
              were included. ECGs were reported by cardiologists and by
              automated software. To assess the relationship between AVB and
              mortality, the log-normal model and the Kaplan-Meier curves were
              used with two-tailed p-values < 0.05 considered statistically
              significant. RESULTS: The study included 1,557,901 patients;
              40.2\% were men, and mean age was 51.7 (standard deviation ± 17.6)
              years. In a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was
              3.35\%. The AVB prevalence was 1.38\% (21,538). Patients with
              first-, second-, and third-degree AVB were associated with 24\%
              (relative survival rate [RS] = 0.76; 95\% confidence interval
              [CI]: 0.71-0.81; p < 0.001), 55\% (RS = 0.45; 95\% CI: 0.27-0.77;
              p = 0.01), and 64\% (RS = 0.36; 95\% CI: 0.26-0.49; p < 0.001)
              lower survival rate when compared to the control group,
              respectively. Patients with 2:1 AVB had 79\% (RS = 0.21; 95\% CI:
              0.08-0.52; p = 0.005) lower survival rate than the control group.
              Only Mobitz type I was not associated with higher mortality (p =

                   million ECGs. ECG-FM is a transformer-based model pretrained
                   using a hybrid contrastive and generative self-supervised

                  remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an
                  ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG
                  research to new heights. However, building such a model faces
                  several challenges, including insufficient database sample
                  sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains.
                  Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between
                  single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG
                  Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that
                  leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts
                  to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis.
                  ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label
                  categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling
                  comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG
                  analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective
                  out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for
                  downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we
                  extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary
                  single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to
                  supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring
                  scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder
                  achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets,
                  with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows
                  strong classification performance and generalization across
                  various diagnoses on external validation sets. When
                  fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in
                  demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and
                  cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and

              algorithms based on machine learning. Major obstacles for the
              development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both
              the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking
              procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To
              address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest
              freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising
              21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The
              ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a
              multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further
              aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad
              range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large
              fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional
              metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements,
              diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as
              well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns
              the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the

              applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the
              CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs
              obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from
              2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A
              hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized
              specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG
              Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic
              statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was
              considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were
              concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc
              rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the
              national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage
              methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified.
              After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients 80\%
              and specificity >99\% in an independent test dataset. We also
              evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of
              atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong
              predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all
              causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large
              database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth
              network can be useful for further developments in the field of
              digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and
              cardiovascular epidemiology.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Worldwide, it is estimated that over 6 million people
              are infected with Chagas disease (ChD). It is a neglected disease
              that can lead to severe heart conditions in its chronic phase.
              While early treatment can avoid complications, the early-stage
              detection rate is low. We explore the use of deep neural networks
              to detect ChD from electrocardiograms (ECGs) to aid in the early
              detection of the disease. METHODS: We employ a convolutional
              neural network model that uses 12-lead ECG data to compute the
              probability of a ChD diagnosis. Our model is developed using two
              datasets which jointly comprise over two million entries from
              Brazilian patients: The SaMi-Trop study focusing on ChD patients,
              enriched with data from the CODE study from the general
              population. The model's performance is evaluated on two external
              datasets: the REDS-II, a study focused on ChD with 631 patients,
              and the ELSA-Brasil study, with 13,739 civil servant patients.
              FINDINGS: Evaluating our model, we obtain an AUC-ROC of 0.80 (CI
              95\% 0.79-0.82) for the validation set (samples from CODE and
              SaMi-Trop), and in external validation datasets: 0.68 (CI 95\%
              0.63-0.71) for REDS-II and 0.59 (CI 95\% 0.56-0.63) for
              ELSA-Brasil. In the latter, we report a sensitivity of 0.52 (CI
              95\% 0.47-0.57) and 0.36 (CI 95\% 0.30-0.42) and a specificity of
              0.77 (CI 95\% 0.72-0.81) and 0.76 (CI 95\% 0.75-0.77),
              respectively. Additionally, when considering only patients with
              Chagas cardiomyopathy as positive, the model achieved an AUC-ROC
              of 0.82 (CI 95\% 0.77-0.86) for REDS-II and 0.77 (CI 95\%
              0.68-0.85) for ELSA-Brasil. INTERPRETATION: The neural network
              detects chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) from ECG-with weaker
              performance for early-stage cases. Future work should focus on
              curating large higher-quality datasets. The CODE dataset, our
              largest development dataset includes self-reported and therefore
              less reliable labels, limiting performance for non-CCC patients.
              Our findings can improve ChD detection and treatment, particularly
              in high-prevalence areas.",
